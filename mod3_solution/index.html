                        Chicking stands for food innovation. Following the introduction of the Mexita range of wraps and
                        sandwiches, the Tandoori Bites and Flaming Grilled Chicken, Pizzas, Pasta were also launched.
                        This was an immediate success. Chicking always serves an exciting and varied menu and draws
                        inspiration from all kinds of taste cultures from around the world. From authentic American,
                        delicious Mexican, inspiring Indian, irresistible Italian to mouth-watering Filipino. Always
                        innovating our dishes, that's where our passion lies. And you can taste it!
                        ChickingÂ® is a chain of fast-food restaurants, or QSR's (quick service restaurants) with a
                        wonderfully varied menu with breaded and fried chicken dishes, wraps, sandwiches and Mexican
                        style variants. Chicking has been developed with a lot of passion and love in Dubai.
                        The first outlet was opened in the United Arab Emirates in 2000. Chicking has become extremely
                        popular, today Chicking is present in more than 23 countries and has more than 2,200 employees
                        in more than 180 stores.
                        Chicking's global expansion is being realized by BFI (Building Franchise Innovations) Management
                        DMCC, a company registered with the Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC) responsible for the
                        marketing, administration, sales and support of Chicking Europe.Depending on the location,
                        Chicking Europe offers potential investors various opportunities to become a Chicking Master
                        Franchisee, a Chicking Area Development Agent or a Chicking Unit / Sub-franchisee.
                        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails
                        and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically
                        of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds,
                        such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same
                        colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from
                        the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male
                        and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their
                        heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks
                        called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are
                        called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds
                        these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken
                        breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.
                        Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are
                        generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they
                        would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but
                        generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
                        After seeing Shane's 8-heart event, each chicken you purchase from Marnie or hatch from a brown
                        or white egg has a 1/4 chance of being blue. Aside from appearance, blue chickens are identical
                        to regular white and brown chickens. One subtle benefit to this alternative color is that blue
                        chickens are much easier to spot in a field of grass, allowing you to pet them more quickly than
                        a white or especially brown chicken who are somewhat camouflaged in the grass.
                        Blue chickens are hatched as blue chicks. As of v1.2, the top of the screen will display the
                        color of chicken at the time of purchase or hatching. If purchasing, you can cancel the purchase
                        and immediately purchase another chick until achieving the color you desire. If hatching from an
                        incubator, you can exit and restart that day until achieving the desired color.
                        Blue chickens may be a reference to "Cojiro", one of a species of chicken called "cucco" in the
                        game "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time".
                        Selling
                        It is possible to sell Chickens. The amount of gold obtained for doing so is dependent on how
                        many hearts the animal has. The more hearts; the higher amount of gold fetched for selling it.
                        The amount of gold obtained for selling a maximum-heart Chicken is Gold.png1,040g.
                        To sell a coop or barn animal, right-click the animal after petting. The friendship/mood
                        interface appears. Move the cursor over the gold coin button at the right to see how much you
                        can sell the animal for. Click that button and the confirmation that follows to complete the
                        sale.
                        Chickens are colored White, Brown, or Blue (the blue variety can be obtained only after seeing
                        Shane's 8-heart event). The color of the chicken is assigned randomly by the game when it is
                        bought or hatched, so after restarting a day you may get a chicken of another color than on the
                        first run. You can also change the color of a chicken before purchase while selecting a coop. A
                        message is shown stating "Choose a Coop for your new White/Brown Chicken". Cancelling the
                        purchase and going back in can change the color. White and blue chickens produce white eggs, and
                        brown chickens produce brown eggs, so it does make a difference if you are trying to complete
                        the Community Center Bundles.
                        Chickens can eat hay or fresh grass. Hay can be purchased from Marnie or harvested from grass
                        using either type of scythe and is dispensed from the hopper inside the coop when a silo is
                        present on the farm, although hay can also be taken out and placed into chests. Alternatively,
                        if there is grass in the yard outside the coop and the coop door is open to let them outside,
                        they will eat the grass rather than hay, and receive a mood boost as well. When let outside,
                        they will return to the coop at around 5pm every day even if they get outside of a fenced area
                        through an open gate or broken spot. This option is not available in winter, during which they
                        will not venture outside even if the doors remain open (additionally, no grass grows in winter),
                        so hay will have to be gathered or bought for the season.
                        Hatchlings or just-purchased chickens do not need to be fed on the same day they arrive on the
                        farm, although they respond as normal to petting. Afterwards, babies and adults require the same
                        care and amounts of food. Baby chicks that are given food reach maturity on the third day after
                        hatching or purchase.
                        Chickens like other animals can be interacted with to raise their happiness/friendship.
